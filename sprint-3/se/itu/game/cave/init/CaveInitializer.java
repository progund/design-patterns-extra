   * from the map Integer,DbRoom but without any exits.
   *
   * Next, loop through the rooms map again, and check
   * the exits. All Rooms now exist in the cave map.
   * So we can set the exits of the Rooms in cave like this:
   * currentRoom.setDirection(Room.NORTH, cave.get(currentDBRoom.north()));
   * 
   * It can be done in several steps of course, but the idea is
   * that we iterate over all the IDs in the map of DbRoom
   * references, and use the fact that we have the cave map
   * which is a map of actual Room references, in parallell.
   *
   * The DbRoom keeps its exits as int IDs, which we can use
   * to get hold of the actual Room with the same ID.
   * With this information we can actually set the exits
   * of the actual Room to a reference to the correct
   * actual Rooms.
   * 
   * If the rooms map of DbRoom references look like this:
{1=Room ID:1 - north: 5, south: 4, east: 3, west: 2 You are standing at the end of a road. Thing: null,
 2=Room ID:2 - north: 0, south: 5, east: 1, west: 0 - You have walked up a hill. Thing: null,
 3=Room ID:3 - north: 6, south: 6, east: 6, west: 1 - You are inside a building. Thing: Skeleton Key
 .....}
 
 * Then we can set the cave's Room with id 1 to have the Room in
 * the cave with id 5 as the North room, and so on.
 * We translate the DbRoom's ID to an actual Room.
